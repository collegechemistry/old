    <h2>Why The History Lesson?</h2>
<p>
Great question. One thing that is key to the understanding of science is that science is a process of trial an improvement. Science gives us the best model and understanding of the natural world available at the time. It is not an unerring and infallible oracle of truth.</p>

<h2>The Ancient Greeks</h2>
<p>
  The earliest known proponent of anything resembling modern atomic theory was the ancient Greek thinker Democritus
(c. 460 – c. 370 BCE). He proposed the existence of indivisible atoms as a response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides">arguments of Parmenides</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes" target="_blank">paradoxes of Zeno</a>.</p>
<p>
Parmenides argued against the possibility of movement, change, and plurality on the premise that something cannot come from nothing. Zeno attempted to prove Parmenides' point by a series of paradoxes based on difficulties with infinite divisibility.
</p>
<p>
  These views were built upon the earlier philosophy of Empedocles who proposed that all the structures of the world were built of four elements; fire, air, water, earth.
</p>
<p>
In response to these ideas, Democritus posited the existence of indestructible atoms that exist in a void. Their indestructibility provided a retort to Zeno, and the void allowed him to account for plurality, change, and movement. It remained for him to account for the properties of atoms, and how they related to our experiences of objects in the world.
</p>

<p>
  Democritus proposed that atoms possessed few actual properties, with size, shape, and mass being the most important. All other properties, he argued, could be explained in terms of the three primary properties. A smooth substance, for instance, might be composed of primarily smooth atoms, while a sour substance is composed of rough or sharp ones. Solid substances might be composed of atoms with numerous hooks, by which they connect to each other, while the atoms of liquid substances possess far fewer points of connection.
Democritus proposed 8 points to his theory of atoms. These are:
<ol>
  <li>
    All matter is composed of atoms, which are bits of matter too small to be seen. These atoms CANNOT be further split into smaller portions.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a void, which is empty space between atoms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are completely solid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are homogeneous, with no internal structure.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are different in: their sizes, their shapes, and their weights.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are the building blocks of life.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
However, Aristotle (384 BCE – 322 BCE) who lived after Democritus and became the most renowned of the Greek philosophers championed Empedocles' view, adding a fifth element, the ether.

</p>
<p>
Aristotle's view held sway throughout the middle ages, and was a key part of the development of the pseudo-science of alchemy.
</p>

<h2>Alchemy</h2>
<p>
  Alchemy was based on the belief that since everything was made of only four elements, you could transmute a mixture into another mixture of the same type. For example, it was believed that lead could be made into gold.

Alchemy's problem was exposed by Antoine Lavoisier when he heated metallic tin in a sealed flask. A grayish ash appeared on the surface of the melting tin, which Lavoisier heated until no more ash formed. After the flask cooled, he inverted it and opened it underwater. He discovered the water rose one-fifth of the way into the glass, leading Lavoisier to conclude that air itself is a mixture, with one-fifth of it having combined with the tin, yet the other four-fifths did not, showing that air was not an element.

Lavoisier repeated the experiment again, substituting mercury for tin, and found that the same happened. Yet after heating gently, he found that the ash released the air, showing that the experiment could be reversed. He concluded that the ash was a compound of the metal and oxygen, which he proved by weighing the metal and the ash, and showing that their combined weight was greater than that of the original metal.
Lavoisier then stated that combustion was not an element, but instead was a chemical reaction of a fuel and oxygen.
</p>
<p>
  Lavoisier's work led him to him do postulate the Law of Conservation of Mass in 1774, which states:<br/>
  <strong>The total mass of all products of a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of all reactants of that reaction.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Law of Conservation of Mass, by itself alone, does not require an atomic view of the elements. Mass could be conserved even if matter were not atomic. The importance of the Law of Conservation of Mass is that it reveals that we can usefully measure the masses of the elements which are contained in a fixed mass of a compound. As an example, we can decompose copper carbonate into its constituent elements, copper, oxygen, and carbon, weighing each and taking the ratios of these masses. The result is that every sample of copper carbonate is 51.5% copper, 38.8% oxygen, and 9.7% carbon. Stated differently, the masses of copper, oxygen, and carbon are in the ratio of 5.3 : 4 : 1, for every measurement of every sample of copper carbonate. Similarly, lead sulfide is 86.7% lead and 13.3% sulfur, so that the mass ratio for lead to sulfur in lead sulfide is always 6.5 : 1. Every sample of copper carbonate and every sample of lead sulfide will produce these elemental proportions, regardless of how much material we decompose or where the material came from. These results are examples of a general principle known as the Law of Definite Propotions proposed by Joseph Proust (September 26, 1754 – July 5, 1826) in about 1806.

</p>
<p>
  <strong>When two or more elements combine to form a compound, their masses in that compound are in a fixed and definite ratio.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Law of Definite Proportions can be used to calculate the relative masses of elements, but quickly runs into trouble. For example, if we use the relative mass of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrogen monoxide (NO) to then calculate the relative mass of hydrogen in ammonia and water, we end up with different masses! (Bummer)
</p>
<p>
  This problem arises from the assumption that there is 1:1 ratio of hydrogen to nitrogen in ammonium as well as a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in water. (I know that you know that's not the case, but remember that the guys who pulled this all together were discovering all of this for the first time.)
</p>
<p>
    Now, instead of comparing water and ammonia, what if we compare the different oxides of carbon (let's call them oxide A and oxide B).
</p>
<p>
  In an experiment, 10 g of oxide A are decomposed, producing 5.71g of oxgen and 4.29 g of carbon. If we simplify this ratio (by dividing both numbers by the lowest - 4.29) we end up with a ratio of 1.33 g oxygen : 1 g carbon.<br/>
  <br/>
If we now repeat this experiment with 10 g of oxide B, we produce 7.27 g of oxygen and 2.73 g of carbon. Simplifying as above, we end up with a ratio of 2.66 g oxygen : 1 g carbon.
<br/><br/>
Taken separately, these don't seem to provide much insight, but if we compare the two results, we notice that the ratio of oxygen to carbon in oxide B is <strong>exactly double</strong> the ratio of oxygen to carbon in oxide A.
<div class="small-5 small-centered columns">
  $$
  \frac{2.66g \quad O_2\quad for\quad Oxide B}{1.33g \quad O_2\quad for \quad Oxide \quad A} = 2
  $$
</div>
</p>
<p>
  This means that there must be exactly twice as much oxygen in oxide B as there is in oxide A. This holds true across almost all compounds (it doesn't work well with polymers and fails completely with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-stoichiometric_compounds" target="_blank">non-stoichiometric compounds</a>, but we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves here....)
</p>
<p>
  This is called the <strong>Law of Multiple Proportions</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>If two elements form more than one compound between them, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  It was proposed by John Dalton (1766-1844) as a part of his ground-breaking "New System of Chemical Philosophy" in 1808.
</p>
<h2>Dalton's Atomic Theory</h2>
<p>
  Modern atomic theory was born with Dalton when he published his theories in 1803. His theory consists of five important points, which are considered to be mostly true today: (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dalton#Five_main_points_of_Dalton.27s_Atomic_Theory" target="_blank">from Wikipedia</a>):
  <ul>
    <li>
      Elements are composed of tiny particles called atoms.</li>
      <li>

All atoms of a given element are identical.
</li>
<li>
  The atoms of a given element are different from those of any other element; the atoms of different elements can be distinguished from one another by their respective relative weights.
</li>
<li>
  Atoms of one element can combine with atoms of other elements to form chemical compounds; a given compound always has the same relative numbers of types of atoms.
</li>
<li>
  Atoms cannot be created, divided into smaller particles, nor destroyed in the chemical process; a chemical reaction simply changes the way atoms are grouped together.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  We now know that elements have different isotopes, which have slightly different weights. Also, nuclear can divide atoms into smaller parts (but nuclear reactions aren't really considered chemical reactions). Otherwise, his theory still stands today.

<h2>Thompson, Millikan, and the Discovery of the Electron</h2>
<p>
  In the year 1889 the British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered the electron. Thomson conducted a number of experiments using cathode ray tube. Cathode rays are constructed by sealing two electrodes in a glass tube and removing the air from it. When the electrodes are attached to high voltage, a beam of radiation is emitted from the negative electrode. These beams are called cathode rays.
Thompson discovered that cathode rays travel in straight lines except when they are bent by electric or magnetic fields. Because the cathode rays bent away from a negatively charged plate, Thomson concluded that these rays are made of negatively charged particles; today we call them electrons. Thompson found that he could produce cathode rays using electrodes of various materials.
By carefully measuring the the magnitude and direction of the cathode rays when these fields were applied, Thompson was able to determine that these particles carried a negative charge. We now know these particles as electrons. Thompson was also able to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio for these particles (1.758x10<sup>11</sup> C/kg)
</p>
<h3>The "Plum-Pudding Atomic Model"</h3>
<p>
  Soon after the discovery of the electron, Thompson began speculating on the nature of the atom. He suggested a "plum pudding" model. In this model the bits of "plum" were the electrons which were floating around in a "pudding" of positive charge to match that of the electrons and make an electrically neutral atom. A modern illustration of this idea would be a chocolate chip cookie, with the chips representing negatively charged electrons and the dough representing positive charge. In this model, the mass of the atom would consist of the sum of the masses of all the electrons in it.
</p>
<h3>Do Electrons Have Mass?</h3>
<p>
  The American physicist Robert Millikan (1868-1953) took interest in Thompson's work, and in 1909 devised an elegant experiment that allowed him to determine the charge of an electron. Since Thompson had already determined the ratio of charge-to-mass for an electron, Millikan's work then allowed for the mass of an electron to be calculated.
<br/><br/>
Millikan devised a container with two internal chambers filled with air. In the top chamber, a fine spray of oil drops fell through a hole into the bottom chamber. Highly energetic X-rays passed through the bottom chamber. These X-rays collided with the molecules in the air (mostly nitrogen and oxygen) and caused them to lose electrons. This resulted in free electrons in the chamber. Some of these free electrons were reabsorbed by the air molecules, but some were absorbed by the falling oil drops.
<br/><br/>
A microscope was attached to the lower chamber, which also contained charged metal plates. Millikan could observe the rate at which these charged oil drops fall, and even control the rate of their descent by varying the charge on the plates. By comparing the rate at which the drops fell to the strength of the electric field he applied, Millikan determined that the charge on each drop was always a whole number multiple of some minimum charge. The conclusion Millikan reached was that this minimum charge (-1.602x10-19 C) was the charge on a single electron.
<br/><br/>
Millikan's work also allowed for the calculation of the mass of an electron (9.11 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg). This posed an immediate problem for the Thompson's "chocolate chip cookie" model. Since the masses of many of the elements were known, it quickly became clear that there were simply not enough electrons to account for the mass of an atom.
</p>
<h2>The Nuclear Atom</h2>
<p>
  Despite the problems raised by Millikan's experiment, the plum pudding model was the prevailing theory on the structure of the atom until it was disproved by Ernest Rutherford in his analysis of the gold foil experiment, published in 1911.

</p>
<p>
  The gold foil experiment consisted of a series of tests in which positively charged alpha particles (helium nuclei) were fired at a very thin sheet of gold foil. If Thomson's Plum Pudding model was to be accurate, the big alpha particles should have passed through the gold foil with only a few minor deflections. This is because the alpha particles are heavy and the charge in the "plum pudding model" is widely spread.
</p>
<p>
  Ernest Rutherford is known for his famous gold foil experiment in 1911. Alpha particles, which are heavy and positively charged (actually, helium nuclei, but that's beside the point), were fired at a very thin layer of gold. Most of the alpha particles passed straight through, as expected. According to the plum pudding model all of the particles should have slowed as they passed through the "pudding", but none should have been deflected. Surprisingly, a few alpha particles were deflected back the way they came.

  According to Rutherford:
  <blockquote>
    It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backward must be the result of a single collision, and when I made calculations I saw that it was impossible to get anything of that order of magnitude unless you took a system in which the greater part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a minute nucleus. It was then that I had the idea of an atom with a minute massive centre, carrying a charge.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden_experiment#cite_note-2">REF</a></sup>
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind, a 15-inch shell has a <strong>diameter</strong> of 15 inches. Such a shell would have been fired from <a href="#" data-reveal-id="15-inch-shell">something like this</a>.

  <p>
  The result of the experiment allowed Rutherford to conclude that the plum pudding model is wrong.<br/><br/>
  <strong>Rutherford's Conclusions:</strong>
<ol>
<li>
  Atoms have a nucleus, very small and dense, containing the positive charge and most of the atom's mass.
</li>
<li>
  The atom consists of mostly empty space.
</li>
<li>
  The electrons are attracted to the nucleus, but remain far outside it.

  Initially, Rutherford proposed that the nucleus contained only protons, . Rutherford's subsequent work led to the discovery of neutrons, which have a similar mass to protons, but no charge. James Chadwick, a student of Rutherford's, discovered the neutron in 1932.
