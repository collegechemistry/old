  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" target="_target">Niels Bohr</a> was able to combine the work of Balmer and Rydberg with that of Thompson, Rutherford, Planck and Heisenberg to produce a new model of the atom. In Bohr's model, electrons orbit the nucleus at defined distances from the nucleus. Each orbit can be assigned an integer from the Rydberg equation, and transitions between orbits result in the absorption or emission of energy.

<p>Bohr was able to combine the equations for the light and energy with the Rydberg equation to be able to calculate the energy of light in the hydrogen emission spectrum rather than just the wavelength.</p>
$$
\Delta E = -2.178 x 10^{-18}J \left( \frac {1}{n_{f}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}} \right)
$$
<p>The energy of an individual orbit can be calculated with:</p>
$$
E = -2.178 x 10^{-18} J \left( \frac {1}{n^{2}} \right)
$$

  <h4>The Significance of n &rarr; &infin;</h4>
  <p>The infinity level represents the highest possible energy an electron can have as a part of a hydrogen atom. So what happens if the electron exceeds that energy by even the tiniest bit?</p>
  <p>
The electron is no longer a part of the atom. The infinity level represents the point at which ionization of the atom occurs to form a positively charged ion.
</p>
</div>
<p>
In Bohr’s model, n is associated with the radius of an electron orbit. The lower the n value, the smaller the radius of the orbit, the lower the energy level. Energy is absorbed when an electron moves from an orbit with a small value of n (close to the nucleus) to an orbit with a larger value of n (away from the nucleus). Energy is emitted when an electron moves from an orbit with a larger value of n to an orbit with a smaller value of n. The energy is emitted in the form of light.</p>
<o>
This model is often referred to as the planetary model of the atom because the electrons orbiting around the nucleus recall the orbiting of planets around a sun.</p>

<h3>Basic Principles of the Bohr Theory</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The electron moves in circular orbits about the nucleus, with the motion described by classical physics.</li>
<li>The electron has only a fixed set of allowed orbits, called stationary states. The allowed orbits are those in which certain properties of the electron have unique values. Even though classical theory would predict otherwise, as long as an electron remains in a given orbit its energy is constant and no energy is emitted.</li>
<li>An elect>ron can pass only from one allowed orbit to another. In such transitions, fixed discrete quantities of energy (quanta) are involved, in accordance with Planck’s equation, E = hv.</li>
</ol>

<div class="panel radius callout">
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>How much energy must be absorbed by a hydrogen atom for its electron to move from n = 5 to n = 6?</p>
  $$
  \Delta E = -2.178 x 10^{-18} J \left( \frac{1}{n_{f}^{2}} - \frac {1}{n_{i}^{2}} \right)
$$

n<sub>i</sub> = 5 <br>
n<sub>f</sub> = 6

$$
\Delta E = -2.178 x 10^{-18} J \left( \frac{1}{6^{2}} - \frac {1}{5^{2}} \right)
$$
$$
\Delta E = -2.178 x 10^{-18} J \left( \frac{1}{36} - \frac {1}{25} \right)
$$
$$
\Delta E = 2.622 x 10^{-20} J
$$
<p><strong>Note:</strong> THe positive value for energy (E) indicates that energy was absorbed by the hydrogen atom in this case.</p>
</div>

<h3>Limitation of the Bohr Model</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, while Bohr’s theory worked beautifully for the Hydrogen atom, it proved impossible to extend it in a quantitatively correct manner to more complicated atoms. Even Helium, with only 2 electrons, proved the model incorrect. With the addition of another electron, the repulsion between to the two electrons also had to be taken into consideration as well as the interaction of the second electron and the nucleus. Bohr's model could not address these issues, and therefore it was wrong or at the least, incomplete.</p>
<p>
The major advance that came out of Bohr’s model of the atom was that it helped scientists of the time to break free from classical physics.</p>
<p>By 1927 it was shown than electrons have a wave nature. Electrons are particles as they are known to have mass. By extension, all particles have a wave nature. Matter exhibits the wave-particle duality just as light does.</p>
<p>However, as this wave nature is only relevant when the size of the particle is on the order of the size of its wavelength, the wave nature of particles is only important at the subatomic level.</p>
<p>This wave nature of particles led us to Wave Theory and Quantum Mechanics. The mathematics of much of quantum theory is beyond most people, but the results of it can be used to explain the nature of the atom.</p>
<p>Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle limits calculating the position and the velocity of an electron in an atom. By recalling that we cannot know with certainty where an electron is an atom is located, we can avoid the inherent problems of trying to understand quantum orbitals in classical terms.</p>
