  Before going any further, it is important to take some time to explore and understand the nature of light.  It turns out that the nature of light and it's interactions with matter play a critical role in the development of atomic theory.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time as Thompson and Millikan were refining Dalton's atomic model, there was a great deal of interest in the nature of light.
</p>
<h2>Light And Energy</h2>
<p>
  Light is composed of electro-magnetic waves.  The different colours of light correspond to different wavelengths.  For example, the human eye can detect light with wavelengths between about <strong>375 nanometers to 750 nanometers</strong>.  A nanometer is abbreviated as <em>nm</em> and 1 nm = 10<sup>-9</sup>m.
</p>

    <p>
      2.2.1 Visible light is only one part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
    </p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like all waves, light waves have both an <em>amplitude</em> and a <em>wavelegth</em>. The amplitude is related to the brightness of the light, and the wavelength determines the energy.  This may seem counterintuitive; it is normal to assume that brighter light has more energy than dimmer light.  This, however, is not the case.</p>
<p>
The energy (in Joules) of light can be calculated by:</p>
$$
E = \frac{hc}{ \lambda}
$$
<p>where <strong><em>h</em></strong> is <em>Planck's Constant</em> (6.6261 x 10<sup>-34</sup> Js), <strong><em>c</em></strong> is the speed of light in a vacuum (3.00 x 10<sup>8</sup> m/s), <strong><em>&nu;</em></strong> is the frequency (in Hz or s<sup>-1</sup>) and <strong><em>&lambda;</em></strong> is the wavelength in meters.  It is interesting to note that there is an inverse relationship between wavelength and energy.  For example, this means that red light (&lambda; = 700 nm) has less energy than blue light (&lambda; = 400 nm).
</p>

<div class="panel callout radius">
  <h4>Caclulating the energy of light</h4>
  <p>Calculate the energy of light with a wavelength of 400 nm.</p>
  $$
  E = h \nu = \frac{hc}{ \lambda} = \frac {(6.6261 x 10^{-34} \bullet 3.00 x 10^{8})}{4.00 x 10^{-9}} = 4.97 x 10^{-17}J
  $$
  <p><strong>Try This:</strong> Calculate the energy of red light with a wavelength of 700 nm.</p>

<h2>Atomic Emission Spectra</h2>

<p>J.J. Thompson was not alone in his interest in vacuum tubes.  Others had also taken a keen interest, and had discovered that these tubes could be filled with differed gasses.</p>
<p>
  Amazingly, when a current was applied to these gas-filled tubes, the gases within emitted light.  Not only that, different gases emitted different colours of light.

    </li>

</ul>
<h3>Hydrogen</h3>
<p>
  In a discharge tube, hydrogen emits a purple light.  Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer" target="_blank">spectrometer</a>, this light can be separated into it's component wavelengths.  It turns out that the purple colour of the hydrogen spectrum is made up of 4 distinct colours.

  </li>
</ul>

<p>While the emission spectrum hydrogen had been known for some time (the exact date of the first obervation is unclear), no recorded attempts to explain it's signficance were made.</p>
<p>In 1885, the Swiss mathematitian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Jakob_Balmer" target="_blank">Johann Balmer</a> derived an equation that fit the four observed lines of the spectrum. </p>
$$
\frac{1}{ \lambda} = 1.097x10^{7} m^{-1} \left( \frac {1}{2^{2}} - \frac{1}{n^{2}} \right)
$$

<p>where <em>n</em> is an <strong>integer greater than 2</strong>. </p>

<p>Initially, only the visible portion of the hydrogen emission spectrum was known, but once the ability to detect and measure the wavelengths of light in the ultraviolet and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Rydberg" target="_blank">Johnannes Rydberg</a> further refined Balmer's equation into the form that we now refer to as the <strong>Rydberg Equation</strong>, which is often written as:</p>

$$
 \frac{1}{ \lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_{f}^{2}} - \frac{1}{n_{i}^{2}} \right)
 $$

 <p> where <em>n<sub>f</sub></em> and <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> are integers and <em>n<sub>f</sub></em> &lt; <em>n<sub>i</sub></em>. <em>R</em> is equal to 1.097 x 10<sup>7</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> and is known as the <em>Rydberg Constant</em>.
 </p>

<p>Balmer and Rydberg did not assign any physical significance to this equation. They simply looked for a way to apply a linear fit to the data.</p>
<div class="panel callout radius">
  <h4>Ballmer, Paschen &amp; Lyman</h4>
  <p>In the Rydberg equation, when n<sub>f</sub> = 2, the corresponding wavelengths occur in the <em>visible</em> portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.  These are referred to as the <strong>Ballmer Series</strong></p>
  <p>When n<sub>f</sub> = 1, the corresponding lines are in the <em>infrared</em> portion of the spectrum.  These have longer wavelengths (and therefore lower energy) than those in the visible region.  They are referred to as the <strong>Paschen Series</strong>. They are named for the physicist Freidrich Paschen, who first observed them in 1908.</p>
  <p>When n<sub>f</sub> = 3, the light emitted is in the <em>ultraviolet</em> portion of the spectrum.  These lines have shorter wavelengths (and therefore higher energy) than those in the visible region.  They are referred to as the <strong>Lyman Series</strong>, after Theodore Lyman, who identified them in 1906.</p>
