title: 2.1 Development of Atomic Theory
---
<h2>Why The History Lesson?</h2>
<p>
Great question. One thing that is key to the understanding of science is that science is a process of trial an improvement. Science gives us the best model and understanding of the natural world available at the time. It is not an unerring and infallible oracle of truth.</p>

<h2>The Ancient Greeks</h2>
<p>
  The earliest known proponent of anything resembling modern atomic theory was the ancient Greek thinker Democritus
(c. 460 – c. 370 BCE). He proposed the existence of indivisible atoms as a response to the arguments of Parmenides, and the paradoxes of Zeno.</p>
<p>
Parmenides argued against the possibility of movement, change, and plurality on the premise that something cannot come from nothing. Zeno attempted to prove Parmenides' point by a series of paradoxes based on difficulties with infinite divisibility.
</p>
<p>
  These views were built upon the earlier philosophy of Empedocles who proposed that all the structures of the world were built of four elements; fire, air, water, earth.
</p>
<p>
In response to these ideas, Democritus posited the existence of indestructible atoms that exist in a void. Their indestructibility provided a retort to Zeno, and the void allowed him to account for plurality, change, and movement. It remained for him to account for the properties of atoms, and how they related to our experiences of objects in the world.
</p>

<p>
  Democritus proposed that atoms possessed few actual properties, with size, shape, and mass being the most important. All other properties, he argued, could be explained in terms of the three primary properties. A smooth substance, for instance, might be composed of primarily smooth atoms, while a sour substance is composed of rough or sharp ones. Solid substances might be composed of atoms with numerous hooks, by which they connect to each other, while the atoms of liquid substances possess far fewer points of connection.
Democritus proposed 8 points to his theory of atoms. These are:
<ol>
  <li>
    All matter is composed of atoms, which are bits of matter too small to be seen. These atoms CANNOT be further split into smaller portions.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is a void, which is empty space between atoms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are completely solid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are homogeneous, with no internal structure.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are different in: their sizes, their shapes, and their weights.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atoms are the building blocks of life.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
However, Aristotle (384 BCE – 322 BCE) who lived after Democritus and became the most renowned of the Greek philosophers championed Empedocles' view, adding a fifth element, the ether.

</p>
<p>
Aristotle's view held sway throughout the middle ages, and was a key part of the development of the pseudo-science of alchemy.
</p>

<h2>Alchemy</h2>
<p>
  Alchemy was based on the belief that since everything was made of only four elements, you could transmute a mixture into another mixture of the same type. For example, it was believed that lead could be made into gold.

Alchemy's problem was exposed by Antoine Lavoisier when he heated metallic tin in a sealed flask. A grayish ash appeared on the surface of the melting tin, which Lavoisier heated until no more ash formed. After the flask cooled, he inverted it and opened it underwater. He discovered the water rose one-fifth of the way into the glass, leading Lavoisier to conclude that air itself is a mixture, with one-fifth of it having combined with the tin, yet the other four-fifths did not, showing that air was not an element.

Lavoisier repeated the experiment again, substituting mercury for tin, and found that the same happened. Yet after heating gently, he found that the ash released the air, showing that the experiment could be reversed. He concluded that the ash was a compound of the metal and oxygen, which he proved by weighing the metal and the ash, and showing that their combined weight was greater than that of the original metal.
Lavoisier then stated that combustion was not an element, but instead was a chemical reaction of a fuel and oxygen.
