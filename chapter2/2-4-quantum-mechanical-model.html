<h3>The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg" targat="_blank">Werner Heisenberg</a> (1901-1976) concluded in 1927 that there is a fundamental limitation to just how precisely we can know both the position and the velocity of a particle at any given time. This limitation arises from the very duality of matter. Why?</p>
<p>
If a particle is very small, in order to locate it accurately we must use radiation of very small wavelengths. By c = ln and E = hn = hc/l we know that small wavelength means high energy. When high-energy radiation strikes the very small particle, the position of the particle changes. The very act of measuring the location of the particle disturbs it and it moves away with an uncertain momentum.</p>
<p>In an atom we would like to know where an electron is located, as well as how fast it is moving. We would like to know its position and its velocity. The velocity of the electron is related to its wave nature. The position of the electron is related to its particle nature. Yet the wave nature and the particle nature of the electrons are complementary properties – by definition complementary properties exclude one another. The more you know about one, the less you know about the other.</p>
<p>
  The hard part about understanding why the location of the electron is impossible to determine is that in classical mechanics Newton’s laws of motion are deterministic. By knowing where something is and how it is moving, one can determine where it will be at a given time. Our macroscopic world experiences make it hard to understand that on the subatomic level the same rules do not apply. The exact position of any electron cannot be known. However, the beauty of quantum mechanics is that it allows us to make predictions about where the electron is likely to be. As long as we can understand probability we can be more comfortable about understanding where the electron MIGHT be.</p>

<p>Mathematically, the Uncertainty Principle is written</p>
  $$
  \Delta x (m\Delta v) > \frac {h}{4 \pi}
  $$
  <p>where &Delta;<em>x</em> is the uncertainty in the position, <em>m</em> is the mass of particle, and &Delta;<em>v</em> is the uncertainty in the velocity of the object.</p>

  <h3>The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation</h3>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" target="_blank">Erwin Schrödinger (1887-1961)</a> addressed the problem of atomic structure by giving emphasis to the wave properties of electrons. Schrödinger’s equation is deceptively brief:</p>
  $$
  H \Psy = E \Psy
