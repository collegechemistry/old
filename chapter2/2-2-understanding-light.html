title: 2.2 Understanding Light
---
<p>
  Before going any further, it is important to take some time to explore and understand the nature of light.  It turns out that the nature of light and it's interactions with matter play a critical role in the development of atomic theory.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time as Thompson and Millikan were refining Dalton's atomic model, there was a great deal of interest in the nature of light.
</p>
<h2>Atomic Emission Spectra</h2>
<p>
  Light is composed of electro-magnetic waves.  The different colours of light correspond to different wavelengths.  For example, the human eye can detect light with wavelengths between about <strong>375 nanometers to 750 nanometers</strong>.  A nanometer is abbreviated as <em>nm</em> and 1 nm = 10<sup>-9</sup>m.

<p>J.J. Thompson was not alone in his interest in vacuum tubes.  Others had also taken a keen interest, and had discovered that these tubes could be filled with differed gasses.</p>
<p>
  Amazingly, when a current was applied to these gas-filled tubes, the gases within emitted light.  Not only that, different gases emitted different colours of light.

<h3>Hydrogen</h3>
<p>
  In a discharge tube, hydrogen emits a purple light.  Using a spectrometer, this light can be separated into it's component colours
